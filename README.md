<h1>Archiving and Logging Data</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This Challenge assignment is designed to solidify and demonstrate my knowledge of the following concepts and tools:


- Creating a <b><i>tar</b></i> archives.
- Using the <i><b>tar</b></i> option <i><b>--exclude=</b></i> to exclude directories.
- Managing backups using <i><b>cron</b></i> jobs.
- Writing bash scripts to create system resource usage reports.
- Performing log filtering using <i><b>journalctl</b></i>.
- Managing log file sizes using <i><b>logrotate</b></i>.
- Creating an auditing system to check for policy and file violations using <i><b>auditd</b></i>.


<h2>Scenario</h2>
I'm a Security Analyst at Credico Inc., a financial institution that offers checking, savings, and investment banking services. 

- The company collects, processes, and maintains a large database of private financial information for both consumer and business accounts.
- The data is maintained on a local server.
- The company must comply with the Federal Trade Commission's Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA), which requires that financial institutions explain their information-sharing practices to their customers and protect sensitive data.

In an effort to mitigate network attacks and meet federal compliance, Credico Inc. developed an efficient log management program that performs: 
- Log size management using <i><b>logrotate</b></i>.
- Log auditing with <i><b>auditd</b></i> to track events, record the events, detect abuse or unauthorized activity, and create custom reports.

These tools, in addition to archives, backups, scripting, and task automation, contribute to a fully comprehensive log management system.
